<p class="drop-cap">IT was a bleak December day in the
year 1620. All day long, the Mayflower
struggled along the coast
amidst the rain and snow, her rudder
broken, her masts split in three
pieces, and heavy seas dashing over
her bow. The men had been called
to man the oars and all were filled
with anxiety and grief and apprehension
of unknown perils to be faced.
It was as if the Almighty would try
them, as he tried Abraham. What
could now sustain them but the spirit
of God and his grace? If they looked
behind them there was the mighty
ocean, which they had passed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
which was now as a main bar and
gulf to separate them from all the
civil parts of the world. If they
looked forward, what could feed their
hopes; what could they see but the
weather-beaten face of the wilderness,
the summer gone and the whole
country full of wild beasts and wild
men? And what multitudes there
might be of them, they knew not.
Locked in the airless cabins, with
the hatches battened down, were the
women and children. Twenty little
children to amuse and keep quiet,
while mother hearts were heavy with
fear and terror. Moving among them
was an English maid, divinely fair
in her beauty. No need for her to
paint her cheeks of damask and rose.
In her strength and beauty she was
as an angel of light to the homesick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Pilgrim women. The day had been
long and dreary to Mary Chilton.
All night she had dreamed and all
day she had thought of dear and
mighty England; of the lanes and
the fields and the songs of the birds,
the faces of the neighbors going about,
and the church at the end of the
village street with the ivy on the
tower. The tears started to her
eyes. She turned away to hide them;
but they did not escape the notice
of John Winslow, who was bending
over the oars. His brave Mary! He
set his face firmly. Surely she must
not falter now; she, who, in her own
splendid health had nursed the sick,
amused the children, restless at the
prolonged confinement, kept the Billington
boy from serious mischief, a
task at which strong men quailed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
and instilled courage and hope in
the hearts of the weak. Even as he
watched her, her tears vanished and
her smile beamed down on the
Billington boy, who spoke to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Mistress Mary, what
am I going to find in my shoe on
Santa Claus morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head gaily&mdash;&#8220;Ah,
that is a secret we must wait to
find out upon the blessed Christmas
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be hay, will it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&mdash;only naughty boys get hay
in their shoes, on St. Nicholas day,
and you&#8217;ve promised me, Francis,
you know, to keep out of mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But will there be something?&#8221;
he insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot promise, Francis; we
must hope and wait.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Between the beat of the oars, John
Winslow called out softly, &#8220;Mary!&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved nearer him. &#8220;What
ails you? Are you sad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart is sore, John. I know it
is wrong. I love my people and my
religion is dear to me, but I wish I
were back in England! Just think,
John, it is the blessed Christmas
week. They are making merry, all
over England, in holly-decked halls,
with great fires roaring up the chimneys.
Feasts are being prepared and
families are drawing together in love
and communion. And look at our
position; tossed on a strange coast,
with no harbor to enter, no friends
to welcome us, no inns to entertain
us and refresh our weather-beaten
bodies, no place to seek for succor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anon,&#8221; said John, &#8220;but Robert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Coppin, our pilot, bids us be of good
cheer, that there is sure to be a creek
or river to enter and escape this
angry sea. And, Mary, I pray you
do not plague your heart about that
young scapegrace Billington. I cannot
comprehend how such a profane
wretch as his father came to be
shuffled in with the company of Pilgrims.
He was not of the Leyden
church, &#8217;tis sure. And that boy, it
is providential that the whole ship
was not blown up when he fired that
fowling-piece almost within four feet
of the gunpowder barrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary shook her head. &#8220;He did not
know the danger. He has been
cooped up and it is hard to keep so
many little boys out of mischief.
With such a father, I grieve for him;
and for all these little children on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
board, that any joy should be cut out
of their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I pray you, Mary, go to your
rest, and I promise you, on my
honor, that the morning light will
bring comfort and joy. Already the
sea is abating and Robert Coppin,
our pilot, says all will be well. Your
example has been a star of hope.
Do not yield to despondency now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not, John. It was the
storm and thinking of Christmas at
home. And you, John, promise me
that when you go ashore I may go
too. I am like the young man in the
Bible; I want to go out to see what
I can see. Goodnight until to-morrow
and may the Lord keep you.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the morning broke bright
and clear, the Mayflower lay inside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
a good harbor wherein a hundred
sail of ships might anchor.</p>

<p>To the weary Pilgrims the first
view of their new home was delightful.
All around were the &#8220;trees of
the Lord,&#8221; the mighty cedars, down
to the very edge of the waters.
There were oaks, pines, junipers,
sassafras, and other sweet woods they
knew not; so the first odors that
greeted them were not from burning
hearth fires but the balsamic odors
of the forest.</p>

<p>When the shallop was made ready,
sixteen armed men, some of the women
with the linen and clothing to wash
on shore, Mary Chilton and John
Winslow, entered it and, it being
flood-tide, made a safe landing on
the shallow beach.</p>

<p>Mary Chilton stepped from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
little shallop on to a large boulder,
and the history of women in America,
and the fame of Plymouth Rock,
began with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The others are so busy with their
linens,&#8221; she whispered to John, &#8220;they
have not noticed that I am the first
woman to step foot on the new land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are the first woman to
step into the kingdom of my heart,&#8221;
said John, softly. And thus, under
the fragrant boughs of the pines,
their troth was plighted.</p>

<p>The other women exclaimed over
the fresh pure water which they
found and the excellent clay which
washed like soap. It had not been
possible to wash on board ship and
it can be imagined they had plenty
to do on this first American &#8220;Washday
Monday.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Mary and John walked down the
dim aisles of the forest. They found
many pure little brooks and drank
the fresh water with delight. They
built a fire to signal to the Mayflower
that all was right. Mary ran
from one tree to another, recognizing
them as old friends. &#8220;Look, John,
it is holly, like our own and yet not
like it; and cedar and, oh, John,
here is the ground-pine, our own
ground-pine, trailing its garlands over
the ground! And walnut trees, full
of nuts, and great store of strawberry
and grape vines.&#8221; Mary&#8217;s face glowed
with a sudden thought. &#8220;John, we
will celebrate Christmas, here in
this new land! It is true we have no
stately halls to deck with greenery,
no great chimneys for the roaring
fires, no old bells to ring out the glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
tidings on the Holy morning, but we
can trim the cabin of the Mayflower
with holly and cedar. Look, here is
wood. We can have a sparkling fire
on the hearth-box. We will have
carols, for you know that we Pilgrims
<i>can</i> sing, John. And we can have
the communion of friends, and we
can show our love like Christians
indeed, one to another.&#8221;</p>

<p>But John shook his head gravely.
&#8220;No, Mary, there will be those who
will protest and mutter against the
observance of the pagan festival. It
savors of Rome, and you know well
that we have set our faces against
anything that is used in Popery.
These are the things from which we
have fled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be so strait-laced, John.
Are we not required to keep in pious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
memory such holy days as the Birth,
Death, and Resurrection? It is meet
that we should commemorate our
landing upon these shores. Do you
know, John, that I am deeply moved
by the thought that all these first
days here are holy days. Although
the glory and the sunlight is hidden
from us by distress, privation, and
sickness, yet I prophesy that long,
long years from now, when our graves
are leveled and all has vanished,
men will stand with bared heads
upon this sacred spot. What we do
now will all be noted. Let it not be
said that we forgot the examples of
oppression and intolerance which have
always been before us: forgot the bitter
lessons we have learned and failed
to be kind and charitable and yielding
in little and indifferent things.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Those are old thoughts for such
a young head, Mary, and in some
way you twist the words to suit
yourself, but go to our dear and
loving friend, Elder Brewster, and
see if he deems it fitting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is so affectionate and tender-hearted,&#8221;
said Mary, &#8220;that I am
sure he will wish to take part in our
joys as he has partaken of our distresses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what I would do if I were
he,&#8221; said John, smiling down at her
happy face, &#8220;I would let you do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But John must not shirk the burden
of the work, which was to procure
firewood and water for use on the
ship, and when the little shallop
returned to the Mayflower it was
laden with casks of fresh water,
boughs of cedar and juniper wood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
garlands of ground-pine, walnuts,
a great store, branches of the red
holly berries, and the waxen sprays
of the bayberries. And Mary Chilton
kept her plan in her heart. Upon
the counsel of Elder Brewster she
went straightway to Master Jones,
the Captain of the ship, and unfolded
it to him.</p>

<p>The Captain was a rough sea-dog,
but capable of goodly feeling
and kindly impulses. He was fair-minded
and friendly and listened to
her with respectful attention, and
when she had done, promised to
lend his aid to make their first Christmas
in the new land as nearly like
an English holiday as their means
and circumstances would permit.</p>

<p>On the 25th of December the little
company assembled at night, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
cabin of the Mayflower. Garlands
of ground-pine decked the walls and
holly boughs graced the posts. The
cedar wood burning on the sand
hearth smelled very sweet and strong.</p>

<p>They kneeled and gave thanks to
God for the completion of their perilous
journey.</p>

<p>Then Elder Brewster said:
&#8220;Friends, we are far from home,
with unknown dangers facing us, but
let us forget, this night, all that may
be in store for us and remember that
the whole civil world is celebrating
the birth of Christ. Let it be understood
that in no way are we departing
from the principles for which we
suffered in England, fled to Holland,
crossed the ocean, and landed here
in this distant, savage, and even dangerous
land. God has not revealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
His whole will to us, but He has made
to burn within us a desire for English
laws, English manners, and an English
home and education for our
children. It is no priestly rite which
we are celebrating here, it is the
manifestation of the &#8216;Pilgrim spirit,&#8217;
this gathering together, in one, as
the children of God, into Christ&#8217;s own
liberty. It is the season of peace
and good-will, when disaffections
are forgotten and friendships are
cemented more closely, and all people,
as the wise men of old, come bearing
gifts. The first Christmas gift,
which is ours from this new land, is
this,&#8221; and he held aloft in his hand
a goblet of sparkling water, fresh and
clear and pure. &#8220;This comes from
a sweet brook that runs under a hillside
and many delicate springs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
is as good water as can be drunk.&#8221;
He pointed silently to the water-casks.</p>

<p>The famished thirsty ones, who
for an hundred days had not tasted
any but stored water, crowded around
the casks and drank their first New
England water with as much delight
as ever they drank drink in their
lives.</p>

<p>Then Elder Brewster pointed to a
large basket of corn or maize, some
red, some yellow, and some marked
with blue, a goodly sight. &#8220;This,
my friends, is a gift of Providence,
without which I do not know what
we would do. We will not eat it
but will guard it as precious seed
with which to make the plantation.&#8221;</p>

<p>They could not admire it enough,
never having seen anything like it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
except in the museum at Leyden.
Scant as their food had been and still
bid fair to be for a space, they all
agreed that this seed was a gift of
God and must be guarded as such.</p>

<p>Elder Brewster went on: &#8220;To-day
no man has rested. Some have
felled timber, some have sawed, some
rived and some carried, but all have
worked without ceasing to lay the
foundations of our first homes in
this wilderness. We receive them
reverently, these free homes, and
promise to guard their hallowed walls
within which our children may first
learn to love their country and their
God.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the great gift, my friends, the
gift that is more than wealth, is the
freedom to worship God after our
own wills, to plant the first colony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
for the glory of God and the advancement
of the Christian faith. God
not only sifted three kingdoms to
get the seed for this enterprise, but
sifted that seed over again. Every
person whom He would not have go
at this time to plant the first colony
of England, He sent back, even from
mid-ocean, in the Speedwell.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is given us to establish the
principles of self-government and
freedom of worship and to deepen
and expand the faith. And now,
friends, thanks to our hunters, we
have a feast prepared of roast goose
and fowls, which will make a pleasant
change from the dried neat&#8217;s tongue
and Holland cheese and biscuits of
the ship&#8217;s diet. We had like to have
some deer,&#8221;&mdash;and here he smiled
knowingly. &#8220;The men saw some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and shot at them but missed them.
Thomas Bradford said that one buck
over the shoulder was worth three
in the bush.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter at
the discomfited hunters and then
they bowed their heads to say grace
and then fell to with many expressions
of good-will. It was sweet and comfortable
to see such lively and true expressions
of dear and unfeigned love.</p>

<p>While they were feasting, Mary
Chilton slipped away. Down in a
lowly bed lay a mother and a young
babe, even as that other mother of
old; low and mean and poor the surroundings,
but holding the hope,
almost divine, of a people.</p>

<p>Mary bent over the brooding
mother and in her face was an adoration
not of earth but of heaven.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;Susanna, are you asleep?&#8221; she
said softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the mother; &#8220;I but
lie here, wondering what this new
land has to give my babe. I am
heart-sick with fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary put a sprig of bayberries in
her slender hand and replied, &#8220;Rather,
Susanna, ask what your babe will
give to the new land. He will give
his strength and his faith and his
youth. Give him to me a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she bore him up to the company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I bring to
you another Christmas gift. I bring
to you a new citizen, born in the land
of the free with no heritage of oppression
and cruelty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A citizen! A citizen! It is an
omen!&#8221; they cried, and little Peregrine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
White was handed around and
admired while the Pilgrims sang, with
lusty voices, the good old English
carol, &#8220;Unto us a child is born.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susanna White, lying there in her
lowly bed, heard and marveled and
was content.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>

<p class="drop-cap2">AND so the gifts were passed, that
first Christmas in 1620. They
reveled in things of the soul rather
than the body. They counted their
tale of gifts and they were good.
The clear, sparkling water; the seed
corn, precious as jewels; the beginning
of the free, fair homes; the
new citizen, the little pilgrim; and
the great gift of self-government and
the freedom to worship according
to the dictates of their consciences
and to deepen and expand the living
faith.</p>
</div>

<p>But the greatest gift of all is the
mighty nation that has sprung from
their loins. They have multiplied as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the stars of the heavens and as the
sand which is on the seashore.</p>

<p>As the children of peace, they have
received peace, and the divine blessing
rests upon them.</p>
